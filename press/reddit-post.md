I've been building tracks for a couple years now - running across mountains with
my brother, hiking with friends, riding across Denmark by bike, these kind of
things.

I'm always looking around for new routes online, and keep running into this
annoying problem: I'll find these amazing multi-day routes (Komoot, AllTrails,
random blogs), but they're mostly split into separate daily tracks. I need them
as a complete route.

So I tinkered around for a couple days and built **GPX Monster** \- the kind of
tool I like to use: quick feedback, no signup or login required, works entirely
in your browser.

**What to expect?**

- Drop in tracks one by one (or all at once)
- Map updates instantly showing your route building up
- Live stats as you add each segment
- See the complete route before you even download
- Everything stays local on your machine

**Real question:** Do other people run into this when scouting new routes? Just
want to give back to the community with something that might be useful.

PS: I've tested it on routes from various sources, but curious how it handles
files from different GPS devices/apps that others use.
